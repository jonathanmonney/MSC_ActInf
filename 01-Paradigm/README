%   This experimental paradigm was created for the purposes of my master’s research project.                              %
%   We used eye-tracking data collection, using Matlab, an EyeLink 1000 eye-tracker, and Cogent 2000 to run the paradigm. %

To run these scripts, you must have the following:

	•	The scripts found in 01-Paradigm/Scripts (see https://github.com/jonathanmonney/MSC_ActInf/tree/master/01-Paradigm/Scripts).
	•	A compatible version of Matlab, running on Windows (as Cogent 2000 is built for Windows only).
	•	An Eyelink 1000 eye-tracker and head-mount.
	•	The images found in 01-Paradigm/Media (see https://github.com/jonathanmonney/MSC_ActInf/tree/master/01-Paradigm/Media).
	•	The Matlab toolbox Cogent 2000 (download here: http://www.vislab.ucl.ac.uk/cogent_2000_terms_and_conditions.php).

For further information on the experimental set-up and paradigm and tasks, please read the methods and materials found here:

****************************
	HOW TO USE:
****************************

	1.	Make sure all paths to the scripts found in 01-Paradigm/Scripts are added to your Matlab session.
	2.	Open « main.m » (this will be the only script you will need to run, all others are functions to be called).
	3.	In « main.m », adjust the direct paths to the images to be loaded by cogent. The path should be the directory 
      		containing the images in 01_Paradigm/Media.
	4.	There is a trial mode and a testing mode. There is also an optional online calibration method, to adjust for any 
     		error in calibration offset.
	5.	There is sample recorded data (performed by myself) that may be found in 01-Paradigm/Sample_Eyelink_Data
